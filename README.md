# My-MacOS-esk-KDE-files
Holds a backup of my dot files for my Elementary OS/MacOS inspired KDE Plasma.

The Plasmoids that I use include CompactShutdown, PlasmaConfigSaver, Better Inline Clock, Window Title, and Ditto Menu.

There is a custom ArcoLinux Menubar Icon in the .icons folder to make it match the Genshin Impact color scheme used.
